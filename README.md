# UMT_Software_Technical_Test
This is the solution that I came up with for the technical test from the UMT Software.
I first did a prunning to check if the given list can be split into the two sublists so they can have the same average, and like this we manage to exclude the ones  that are not checking this criteria from the start. After this, with the use of dynamic programming to create a data structure that holds the sum of subsets( first of 0 item, 1 item , then 2 items and so on, until we have m = n/2 + 1 items). After that we go through the set and see if the current value is found somewhere else in the set. The input that needs to be given for this programm to behave corespondingly id a list on a single row, its items need to be separated by a space character(" ").
